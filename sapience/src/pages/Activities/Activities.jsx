                The first competition challenges drones to navigate a GPS-denied environment, simulating a disaster-stricken building. Drones must rely on onboard sensors and advanced navigation algorithms to manoeuvre through confined spaces and create detailed maps of the area. Additionally, drones must identify people in need, detect hazards and obstacles, and deliver aid to those requiring assistance. This competition tests the drones' ability to operate effectively in close quarters and under challenging conditions.
